## Welcome! 

Thanks for checking out my coming soon landing page project

## The project

My goal for this project was to create a coming soon landing page that different companies use to promote their products. In this case, it was for a fictional developer conference that would take place next year.

This project continuously counts down from the original date up until the day of the conference. From there, the timer will stop and will display a landing page titled "Launched!"

## Tools I used 
HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any to give on this project please email deanlauvina7@gmail.com

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Thanks again for stopping by and have a great day!**
